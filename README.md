##Dapper
In this Project, we’ll learn how to use Dapper in the ASP.NET Core Web API project. We’ll talk about Dapper overall, how to use different queries and executions, how to execute stored procedures, and how to create multiple queries inside a transaction. We’ll also create a simple repository layer to wrap the logic up to avoid using Dapper queries directly inside the controller.

i hope so enjoy That.
